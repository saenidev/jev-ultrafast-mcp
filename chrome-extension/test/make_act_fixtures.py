"""Produce the extension's execution-layer fixtures with the real Python code.

`lib/session.js` is the third port in this extension: `browser.py`'s op dispatcher, which is where a
replay's clicks are actually made. Three kinds of thing in it are worth holding to Python by fixture
rather than by eye.

**The tables.** `MODIFIERS` and `KEY_SPECS` turn `ctrl+shift+k` into a virtual key code. A wrong
entry is not an exception, it is the wrong keystroke: the page receives something, nothing fails,
and the report says `ok`. Nothing else in the system can notice that.

**The two refusal rules.** `confirm_reason` is what stops an unattended replay at "Buy now", and
`is_secret` is what stops it typing a value into a password field. A port that got either of these
subtly wrong would not report a problem — it would click, or type, and look exactly like success.
So both are compared against Python for a spread of names and roles, along with `check_url`, which
is the third one: the domain envelope that decides whether a `nav` step is allowed to run at all.

**The report's floats.** A resolve score crosses JSON, which does not remember that the server held
it as a float, so `1.0` arrives here as `1`. `FLOAT_CASES` freezes Python's `str(round(v, 3))` for
every score the matcher can return, integral ones included. This family exists because a live replay
once printed `(1)` where the tool printed `(1.0)`.

Regenerate after touching `browser.py`, `safety.py`, `config.py` or the port:

    .venv/bin/python chrome-extension/test/make_act_fixtures.py

`tests/test_act_port.py` fails if the committed file is not what this script produces.

# A resolve score is a float in Python however integral it looks, so the tool writes `(1.0)` for a
# perfect match; JSON keeps no trace of that and the extension printed `(1)`. Neither this fixture
# nor the port's own tests could see it, because every recorded score they carried happened to be
# non-integral, where `1.5` and `1` agree. The real replay of a macro that matched perfectly is what
# printed the two side by side. So the fix is pinned twice over: `FLOAT_CASES` below holds the
# formatting primitive to Python, and `test/act-parity.mjs` asserts the header actually reaches for
# it. What is still owed to the live check is the header's *wording*, not its arithmetic.
