"""Tests for the Chrome extension that shows the element table.

The extension is a second implementation of something the server already does, and the only reason
it is allowed to exist is that it is not a second implementation at all. It ships the server's own
observer byte for byte and renders with a port of `observe.py` that is held to the real renderer by
fixtures generated from Python. Both of those are claims. A claim nothing checks is how this project
ended up with a broken image on its own PyPI page, so they get checked here.

Two of these tests paid for themselves before the extension was even finished. The observer emits
`offscreen`, the header counts it and prints "(offscreen N, » = will scroll on act)", and
`Observation.from_raw` never read it -- so the note was unreachable text. The same was true of
`inViewport`, which made the `»` flag on an element dead code. Both surfaced as parity failures
between the port and Python rather than as a bug report, which is the entire argument for having a
port and a parity harness at all.
