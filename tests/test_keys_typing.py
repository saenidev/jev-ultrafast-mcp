"""`keys` is a second way to type, and every text rail was written against `type` alone.

`_dispatch_keys` sends a bare single character with `Input.insertText` rather than as
a key press. That is a reasonable thing for it to do and it is documented nowhere, so
`keys` was a way of putting text on the page that no other part of the server knew
about. Two consequences, both from one op:

- `type` demands `confirm` before it will write into a field whose value must not leave
  the page, and `keys` did not. A password could be filled a character at a time with
  no confirmation at all -- `{"op": "keys", "keys": ["h", "u", ...]}`.
- `_record` replaces a secret `type`'s text with `{{secret}}` before it reaches disk,
  and it keys off `op == "type"`. A `keys` op was recorded verbatim, so a recording
  that filled a password wrote the password into the macro file.

`docs/DESIGN.md` claimed both rails held for password fields. They held for one of the
two ops that can fill one. The op is refused now rather than confirmed, and the tests
below pin the refusal, its narrowness, and the thing that makes it checkable at all:
`_inserts_text` and `_dispatch_keys` have to answer the same question the same way.

Two further shapes came out of the same branch. `{"keys": 5}` raised `TypeError`
*through* `_run_op`'s except clause -- the fourth refusal in this codebase to escape as
a protocol-level crash, and a divergence from the extension, which reports it as
`invalid_request`. And `{"keys": {"a": 1}}` was worse than either: a dict iterates, so
it pressed "a" and reported success.
