"""Two ops click, and the confirmation rail was written against one of them.

`_do_click` has exactly two callers: the `click` op, which consults
`confirm_reason`, and the `toggle` op, which did not. So `{"op": "toggle", "ref":
<a button named "Delete account">}` pressed it with no question asked. This is the
`keys` finding one level down: there, a text rail was attached to the op that is
*spelled* `type` rather than to the act of typing; here a click rail is attached
to the op spelled `click` rather than to the act of clicking. A guard with two
call sites is a guard with one.

The same branches had two more holes with the same cause, and one repair closes
all three -- both rails now read the element the *server* observed.

**The op's `role` was what the rails read.** `confirm_reason` uses the role to
decide whether the name is an action name at all, and it was being handed the
caller's claim about the target rather than a fact about it: `role: "checkbox"`
on a button named "Delete account" returned None and lifted the rail outright.
`is_secret` only ever *adds* strictness for a role, so there the same claim
produced the opposite error -- a refusal nobody asked for, over an ordinary
field. Nothing in this repo ever sent one, which is the only reason it was
latent rather than live; the role now comes from the observation, which the
guard has already re-checked against the page.

**The `type` rail read only the label.** A password field with no accessible
name -- the ordinary shape of a login form -- was typed into with no
confirmation while `observe.py` still masked its value. The mask was wider than
the rail that is supposed to stop and ask, so the property this file pins is
that the two are the same width, measured through the renderer the agent
actually reads.

`chrome-extension/test/act-fixtures.json` covers the name-and-role half on both
sides of the port. It cannot cover the element-derived half, because its
scripted page carries no actions at all -- deliberately, so that both sides are
in the same state. That half is here.
