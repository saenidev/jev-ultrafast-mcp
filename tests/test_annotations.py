"""MCP annotations decide whether a host stops to ask before every call.

Leaving them off is not neutral. An unannotated tool reads as "could do
anything", so a careful client confirms *every* call — including the reads that
make up most of an agent loop. `browser_observe` is the highest-frequency call
in the whole surface and cannot change anything, so having it prompt is the
single most annoying thing this server can do to a user.

These tests pin the read/write split so a new tool cannot quietly land
unannotated, which would silently reintroduce a prompt per call.
