"""Tests for the files that describe the project rather than run it.

The README is the product page, `server.json` is what the MCP registry reads, and `pyproject.toml`
is what the packaging indexes read. All three are hand-written prose about behaviour that lives in
code, which is exactly the kind of thing that goes stale without anyone noticing -- the READMEs
described this project as needing no key at all for as long as they did because nothing checked.

So these tests assert the claims that carry weight, not the wording: that the registry entry agrees
with the package, that the files the READMEs link to exist, that every tool the server registers is
named where a reader looks for it, that the sentences about keys keep saying the true thing, and
that the one-line summaries still say what the project is actually for.
