"""Tests for the Claude Desktop bundle.

A `.mcpb` is a zip plus a manifest, and the manifest is a set of promises about what is inside:
which version, which tools, and which file to run. Nothing executes a manifest, so every one of
those promises is the kind that goes stale without anyone noticing.

That is not hypothetical here. The first version of this manifest pointed `entry_point` at
`jev_ultrafast_mcp/server.py`, which cannot be an entry point at all -- it uses relative imports,
so running it as a script dies with "attempted relative import with no known parent package". The
manifest validated against its own schema regardless, because the schema only asks whether the
field is a string. The bundle was unpacked and the entry point was actually run to find it, and
these tests exist so that finding does not have to be repeated by hand.
