"""What turbo mode does when the provider — or the page — misbehaves.

Turbo mode spends money on every step, so its two failure modes are the ones
that cost the most:

  * the *provider* answers something other than the documented contract. The
    decision model is reached through several routes (TypeSafe direct,
    OpenRouter, a gateway), and each can answer with a proxy error page, a
    differently-shaped envelope, or nothing at all. Every one of those is a
    failed decision — no action was executed — and must be reported as such.
    A `KeyError` / `JSONDecodeError` escaping the tool does not say that: the
    host sees a protocol-level crash, cannot tell "the model refused" from
    "the server has a bug", and does not learn that the page is untouched.

  * the *page* keeps invalidating the refs. Re-observing is the right recovery,
    but "bounded" has to mean something specific: bounded per step (one busy
    page mid-goal must not use up the recovery budget of the steps after it)
    and bounded for the whole goal (a page that never settles must not turn
    `max_steps=20` into an unbounded number of billed requests).

No network, no browser, no key: the provider is faked at `policy._post` and the
session at `server._session`.
