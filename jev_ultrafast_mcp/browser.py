"""Session management and guarded execution.

The safety property that matters: a ref is a code-owned handle on a live DOM
node. The agent never authors a selector, a coordinate, or a snippet of
JavaScript. Every input is re-validated inside the page immediately before it
is dispatched, and a mutation is never retried.

The speed property that matters: freshness and geometry checks are answered by
the page itself (`__jevMcp.verify` / `__jevMcp.resolve`), so a step costs a few
hundred bytes on the wire instead of a full guard table.

        Two routes reach a page: attaching a session to a target we just created
        (`_attach_page`) and attaching one to a tab that already exists
        (`switch_tab`). These calls are documented as session-scoped, so the
        second route looks like it must re-issue them.

        Measured on this build, it does not. With `switch_tab` skipping this
        block entirely, a switched-to tab still reported `window.innerWidth` as
        `cfg.window`, still answered `document.hasFocus()` true, still ran rAF,
        and still fired a document-start script after navigating itself. Chrome
        applies these to the *target*, so a re-attach inherits them and skipping
        the block costs nothing observable today.

        It is shared anyway, because that is not a property to rely on. The
        scoping is undocumented, it is the sort of thing a Chrome release
        changes, and the failure would be silent -- a tab read through the wrong
        viewport produces an ordinary-looking observation, not an error. One
        block means the next per-session setting added here cannot be forgotten
        there.

        `Network.enable` is here for the same reason rather than because it
        shares the scoping question: it is what makes `page_is_idle` able to
        see that a page is still fetching, and a session that skipped it would
        quietly go back to settling on a shell.

        `Target.activateTarget` is deliberately *not* part of it. Bringing a
        window to the front is a decision about the user's desktop, not about
        the session, so it stays in `_attach_page`, where `background` governs

        CI reports `Page.captureScreenshot: timed out after 30.0s`: the command is
        accepted and no frame comes back inside the client's own timeout, so it is
        a stall rather than a refusal. A retry is the remedy, and the run that
        proved it needed one twice -- both captures in the same section timed out
        on their first attempt and both succeeded on the second, and without the
        retry that job would have been red like most of its predecessors.

        The mechanism is *not* established, and the first guess was wrong: it is
        not "the first capture after a tab is closed and another promoted",
        because in the run above the second capture -- sent immediately after the
        first had succeeded -- stalled too. What survives is something about the
        state or the moment rather than the ordinal: it reproduces on CI's Chrome
        (152) and never on the local one (153) across a dozen runs, the page
        reports itself visible either way, and it hit one matrix entry out of
        three on the same commit and the same runner image, which reads as
        scheduling noise rather than a version.

        A silent retry would turn a real defect into a slow green build, so the
        step carries the fact that it happened: if this starts firing on every
        run, that is visible in the report instead of hidden behind a pass.

        The note is `None` and not `""` when there was no retry, because
        `Step.to_dict` drops `None` and keeps empty strings: a `""` would put a
        `detail` field on every successful step, which the extension's port does
        not emit, and the two reports are compared field for field.
