"""Configuration. Everything is environment-driven so an MCP client can set it.

No key is needed for the browser path: open, observe, act, assert and macro all
run against a local Chrome and never call out. A decision model is opt-in, and it
is reachable through two APIs that are both supported here:

    JEV_PROVIDER=typesafe     Jev's own API, paid for with TYPESAFE_API_KEY (the default)
    JEV_PROVIDER=openrouter   the same model through OpenRouter, paid for with
                              OPENROUTER_API_KEY and no TypeSafe account

`TYPESAFE_BASE_URL` still overrides the decisions URL for either, and is what the
provider is inferred from when `JEV_PROVIDER` is unset, so every existing
configuration keeps working. Without a key, `browser_goal` reports
`turbo_unavailable` and executes nothing, while the rest of the surface is
unaffected.
