"""MCP surface.

Ten tools. The important design choice is what is *not* here: there is no
`javascript`, no `click_at(x, y)`, and no `query_selector`. An agent can only
name a ref that the server observed, and the server only dispatches input after
re-checking that the ref still means what it meant. That property is what makes
it safe to hand a browser to an autonomous agent over MCP.

Fast browser control for agents.

Hand the task over. A browser task -- fill this form, check in here, find that
and click it -- goes to browser_goal(goal, url, verify=[...]) in one call: it
opens the page, drives the loop server-side with a decision model, and proves
the outcome with `verify`. Do not drive a task yourself, click by click; that is
what this server is for.

Reading a page is not a task. browser_open / browser_observe / browser_assert
are direct, free, and need no key -- use them to inspect, to read a value, or to
work out why a goal failed. The only other reason to fall back is browser_goal
answering `turbo_unavailable`, which means no model key is configured.

The manual loop, for those two cases only:
    browser_open -> read the element table -> browser_act -> browser_assert.

The element table lists one line per actionable control:
    e12 btn  "Sign in"
    e7  inp* "Where from?" ▸ "San Francisco"
    e8  sel* "Passengers" ▸ "1 adult" opts{1 | 2 | 3}
    e9  chk· "Nonstop"
    e30 btn⊘ "Submit"
Flags: `*` accepts TYPE, `▸` shows the current value, `✓`/`·` is the checked
state, `▾` is expanded, `⊘` means covered by another element right now.

Rules that keep it fast and correct:
  1. Refs are stable across observations. e37 keeps meaning the same control
     until that element is removed, so a plan written three steps ago still holds.
  2. Pass a list of ops to browser_act and they run in order in one round trip.
     Reach for several ops per call instead of one.
  3. Observations after an action are deltas. `= no change` means the last action
     did nothing — change strategy, do not repeat the ref.
  4. A step that fails says why (occluded, stale, out_of_viewport). The right
     response is usually to observe again, not to retry.
  5. Prove the outcome instead of trusting a summary: pass `verify` to
     browser_goal, or call browser_assert. Do not infer success from "no error".
  6. After discovering a path, record it as a macro: replay costs no tokens.

# How a host decides whether a tool call needs a human. Leaving these off is not
# neutral: an unannotated tool reads as "could do anything", so a careful client
# confirms *every* call — including the reads that make up most of an agent loop
# (observe, assert, sessions, doctor). Declaring reads as reads is what lets a
# host stop interrupting them, and the hint is cheap insurance even where the
# client ignores it.
#
# `openWorldHint` is per tool, and a tool with one action that reaches a new host
# is an open-world tool: `browser_act` can `wait`, and it is still `WRITES`.
# `browser_tabs` was `WRITES_LOCAL` because listing and closing tabs are local,
# but `action="new"` creates a target at a caller-supplied URL — the same thing
# `browser_open` does, and it is annotated open-world. It already declares
# `readOnlyHint=False`, so a host is confirming it either way; saying "local"
# bought no fewer prompts and was simply untrue.

    after: absent from the first read, present from the second. A goal handed
    that first table can only answer BLOCKED, or click at something that is not
    there yet, which is what makes a working goal look impossible.

    Two reads agreeing on the ref set is not on its own evidence that the page
    has finished, which is the trap this used to fall into. An app that has not
    fetched its bundle yet renders a shell, and a shell is perfectly still:
    measured on cloudstudio.net's user centre, three elements held across every
    poll until the bundle and the session lookup landed, so a first read that
    trusted agreement handed the model a page with no controls on it — twice on
    the same page, while the loaded version was a second away. Agreement
    therefore settles the page only once the page has also stopped fetching;
    see `Session.page_is_idle`.

    Stop as soon as both hold, so a page that is already rendered costs one

    This is the entry point for browser work, not an optimisation on top of the
    manual loop. Pass `url` and the goal and the page is opened and driven to
    the end here: one call, one host turn, instead of a turn per click.

    Leave `url` out when the task continues from a page an earlier step left
    behind; the goal then runs against whatever the session is already showing.

    Each step costs one request (operation + every target head in a single
    speculative fan-out). `verify` runs browser_assert-style checks on the final
    page, so the result is a fact rather than a model's claim of success.

    The decision model is reachable through two APIs and both are supported here.
    `JEV_PROVIDER=typesafe` uses Jev's own API with TYPESAFE_API_KEY;
    `JEV_PROVIDER=openrouter` routes the same model through OpenRouter with
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY and no TypeSafe account. Same model, same contract either
    way. Reading a page needs no key at all, so when no key is set the handoff is
    unavailable while browser_open, browser_observe and browser_act keep working.
