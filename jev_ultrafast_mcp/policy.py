"""Optional TypeSafe "turbo" policy.

The default mode of this MCP needs no model at all: the calling agent reads the
element table and picks a ref. When a TypeSafe key *is* present, this module
lets the server run the loop itself, using speculative fan-out — one request
carries the operation head plus one target head per available operation, so a
step costs a single network round trip instead of a host-agent turn.

Nothing here is on the critical path. Without a key it reports unavailable and
the rest of the server behaves identically.

autocomplete suggestion selected; when no listed suggestion matches the query, SUBMIT

then the confirmation.
Set every requested filter; a matching result alone does not prove a filter was applied.

HOVER that trigger, then choose from the menu it reveals on the next step.
Repeating an operation on one element is not progress: the element's own state can
flip while the goal stands still, and a target that has been retried stops being offered.
